## Description

Still in the planning/design phase. I will update this when more details are
available.

## Development

This time around, breaking with the tradition of developing my Ludum Dare games
as JavaScript web games using Phaser, I have opted to develop this one using
SFML in C++. This should give me a lot more flexibility at a lower level, but it
will undoubtedly present new challenges that I haven't had to face in past Ludum
Dare entries, especially in terms of compiling and distributing the game across
multiple platforms. While I have done some C++ game development in the past,
I have yet to publish a completed C++ game, and I have never worked with SFML
prior to starting this project, so that will present some challenge as well.
Here's to hoping everything goes well!

This year, my plan is to focus more heavily on rapid prototyping than ever
before in the past. In my last Ludum Dare (39), I focused far too heavily on
detailed design before programming anything usable to test my ideas and theories
on. As a result, I underestimated the complexity of key parts of my game design
and found them difficult to work around in the limited time frame available.
This time I'd like to give myself a chance to detect those design flaws before
overcommiting to the problematic concept at all.

To my fellow Ludum Dare participants, good luck, and I'm looking forward to
playing your games soon!
